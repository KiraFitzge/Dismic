\title{Parse censored data in the form used by EdFacts.}
\usage{
parse_censored_data_edfacts(vect, maxnum = 100, minnum = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{vect}{character vector to parse}

\item{maxnum}{maximum for purposes of GE and GT}

\item{minnum}{minimum for purposes of LE and LT}
}
\value{
numeric vector of parsed data (with NA where the parse failed)
}
\description{
You have numeric data stored like 75-80, GE75, LE25, LT50 etc. You want to replace with the midpoints (a common approach). This function does this parsing.
}
\details{
In particular the censored data looks like this:

* numbers are like 75-80, with a dash in the middle meaning that it is somewhere in that range; or

* numbers are like GE75, meaning >=75

* numbers are like LE25, meaning <=25

* numbers are like LT50, meaning <50 (effectively the same as <=50 and treated as such here)

Given a character vector, this function returns a numeric vector that:

* returns the midpoint of things that look like 75-80 e.g.;

* returns (maxnum+75)/2 for GE75 e.g.;

* returns (minnum+25)/2 for LE25 e.g.
}
\note{
The name of the function will hopefully prevent conflicts with other packages but the method is probably more general than edfacts data.
